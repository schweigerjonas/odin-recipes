            <li>Par-baked Sweet Potato - 4 medium pieces</li>
            <li>Butter - 4tbsp</li>
            <li>Crème Fraiche - 1/2 cup</li>

            <li>Toasted Pine Nuts - 4tbsp</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper - to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Broccoli</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, gently heat the olive oil and grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook until lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Add the herbs and allow to sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add vinegar, sugar, mustard, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes on low heat until the sugar dissolves. Toss the grilled broccoli with the warm vinaigrette.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sweet Potato</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wrap each par-baked sweet potato in foil with 1 tbsp butter in each parcel.</li>
            <li>Put on the grill in a spot without direct heat. Allow to finish cooking until tender.</li>
            <li>To serve, split the sweet potato, add crème fraiche, pine nuts, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow tomahawk to come to room temperature, covered, for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pat steak completely dry, several times as needed.</li>
            <li>Very lightly rub grapeseed oil on steak, not enough to drip off, just enough for the seasoning to stick.</li>
            <li>Season liberally with salt and pepper all over.</li>
            <li>Place on a pre-heated hot grill. Depending on what kind of grill you have, cooking directions will vary. I have a pellet smoker grill, so I start with a low smoke for 30-40 minutes and reverse sear on a hot grill.</li>
            <li>After searing, remove steak from grill and rest (under a tent of foil, if you like) when you are 5-10 degrees from the desired temperature. I like medium-rare so I will cook it on the grill until the internal temperature is 49-50C / 120-122F, allowing for residual heat to bring it up to 53-54C / 128-130F.</li>
        </ol>
